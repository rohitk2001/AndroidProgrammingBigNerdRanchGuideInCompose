Model

Refer to classes that contain information that UI will display.

Data classes

Compiler helps in defining useful functions like equals(), hashCode(), and toString() for this.

@StringRes

This annotation is not required/mandatory.
But this helps the code inspector(Lint) verify at compile time that constructor calls provide a valid string resource ID, and also makes code more readable.

** Even with material 3 dependency in build.gradle, will need to still add icons dependency separately. `implementation(libs.androidx.compose.material3)implementation(libs.androidx.material) implementation("androidx.compose.material:material-icons core")
 implementation("androidx.compose.material:material-icons-extended")`

View Binding

Feature of build process that generates boilerplate code for your app.
Not enabled by default, need to add following in app build.gradle:
android { 
    buildFeatures {
        viewBinding true
    }
}

Now in MainActivity.kt:
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    private lateinit var binding: ActivityMainBinding
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        binding = ActivityMainBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(binding.root)
        binding.trueButton.setOnClickListener { view: View → … }
    }
}

ActivityMainBinding allows you to get references to each UI element in your activity_main.xml layout.
**for activity_cheat.xml ; it will generate ActivityCheatBinding

Screen Pixel Densities

Android provides density-independent dimension units that you can use to get the same size on different screen densities.
Android translates these units using device’s defined density bucket to pixels at runtime.
Density Bucket: LDPI, MDPI, HDPI , … , XXXHDPI
px : pixel , 1 pixel → one onscreen pixel, regardless of display density
** because they do not scale appropriately with device density, their use is not recommended 
dp: density-independent pixel, 1 dp → 1/160 of an inch of device’s screen
you get same size regardless of screen density.
sp: scale-independent pixel, density-independent pixel that also take into account the user’s font size preferences
pt, mm, in: scaled units, not all devices are correctly configured for these units to scale correctly
