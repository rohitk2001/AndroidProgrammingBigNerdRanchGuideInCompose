Android SDK Versions

A device with a proprietary version of Android is not able to run a new version of Android released by Google. Instead it must wait for a compatible proprietary upgrade.

Minimum supported version

Minimum SDK version your app can run on.
**API level 23 (Android 6.0 Marshmallow) in 2026**

We can also set target version and compile version in build.gradle file:
 

`android {    
    namespace = "com.bignerdranch.geoquiz"    
    compileSdk = 34    
    defaultConfig {        
        applicationId = "com.bignerdranch.geoquiz"        
        minSdk = 24        
        targetSdk = 34 // Align targetSdk with compileSdk for stability  
     }    
     compileOptions {        
         sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17        
         targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17    
     }    
     composeOptions {        
         kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion = "1.5.13"    
     }    
}`

Minimum SDK version

The minSdk value is a hard floor below which the OS should refuse to install the app.

Target SDK version

The targetSdk value tells Android which API level your app is designed to run on.
If we set this lower than latest available, then the new features will not be available for use, but the devices would be still able to install and run the app correctly.

Compile SDK version

The compileSdk specifies which version to use when building your code.

Safely Adding code from later APIs

To avoid the Android Lint errors for using features which are available for certain SDK but not min SDK, is to use @RequiresApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.S) on that feature/method.
But when using or calling that method we need to add the below check:
if(Build.VERSION.SDK_INT ≥ Build.VERSION_CODES.S) { // call that new method }
